# 🎧 **Spotify Review Classification using NLP** 📝✨  

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
Music lovers leave thousands of reviews on **Spotify** daily. Some are **positive 🎉**, some are **negative 😡**, and some are **neutral 🤔**. But how do we analyze these reviews **at scale**? This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Machine Learning** to automatically classify Spotify reviews into:  
✅ **Positive** 🎶 – Users love the app!  
❌ **Negative** 🚫 – Users are unhappy.  
⚖️ **Neutral** 😐 – Mixed or average opinions.  

## 🎯 **Objective**  
✔️ Build an **NLP-powered sentiment analysis model**.  
✔️ Classify Spotify reviews as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.  
✔️ Help businesses understand **customer feedback at scale**.  

## 📊 **Dataset Used**  
The dataset consists of **Spotify user reviews**, containing:  
📝 **Review Text** – The actual user review.  
🌟 **Rating** – Star rating .  
🏷 **Sentiment Label** – Labeled as **positive, negative, or neutral**.  

## 🏗 **Tech Stack**  
🧠 **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes.  
📚 **NLP Techniques:** Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization.  
📊 **Vectorization:** TF-IDF, Word2Vec.  
🐍 **Programming Language:** Python.  
🔍 **Libraries Used:** NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.  

## 🔍 **How It Works?**  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and normalize text (remove stopwords, punctuation, special characters).  
2️⃣ **Feature Engineering** – Convert text into numerical vectors (TF-IDF, Word2Vec).  
3️⃣ **Model Training** – Train ML models on labeled review data.  
4️⃣ **Sentiment Prediction** – Classify new reviews as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.  
5️⃣ **Performance Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  

## 📈 **Performance Metrics**  
✔️ **Accuracy Score** – Measures overall model correctness.  
✔️ **Precision & Recall** – Evaluates classification effectiveness.  
✔️ **Confusion Matrix** – Visualizes classification results.  

## 🛠 **Features**  
🎯 **Automated Sentiment Detection** – Instantly classifies reviews.  
📊 **Multi-Model Comparison** – Choose the best-performing model.  
📉 **Handles Large Datasets** – Scalable for real-world use.  
🌍 **Future API Integration** – Connect to real-time Spotify reviews.  

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**  
🔹 **Deep Learning Models (LSTMs, Transformers)** for better accuracy.  
🔹 **Multilingual Support** – Classify reviews in different languages.  
🔹 **Live Dashboard** – Visualize trends in user feedback.  

## 🏁 **Conclusion**  
This project **automates sentiment analysis** of Spotify reviews, helping businesses and developers gain **insights into user satisfaction**! 🚀🎵 **Let the data decide the mood!** 😃🎶
